TruckDrive is a long-range autonomous highway driving dataset designed for heavy-truck safety, perception, prediction, and planning research. It targets high-speed highway operation, where reliable scene understanding hundreds of meters ahead is required for anticipatory planning and safe braking.

This repository hosts the **TruckDrive Devkit** together with release documentation.

## Highlights

- **475k** synchronized multimodal samples
- **165k** densely annotated frames
- up to **1,000 m** for 2D benchmark annotations
- up to **400 m** for 3D benchmark annotations
- **7** long-range FMCW LiDARs, **3** short-range LiDARs, **10** 4D radars, and **11-15** cameras
- supports perception, tracking, depth estimation, prediction, planning, and end-to-end driving

## Dataset Overview

TruckDrive targets long-range, highway-scale autonomous driving for semi-trucks and other heavy commercial vehicles. It is designed to stress perception and planning systems beyond the short-range assumptions common in urban autonomous-driving benchmarks.

## Dataset Viewer

This repository includes an interactive dataset viewer for inspecting TruckDrive scenes in 3D and 2D. The viewer supports synchronized LiDAR, radar, camera images, 3D bounding boxes, lane lines, accumulated depth overlays and video export.

For installation instructions, expected dataset layout, coordinate-frame conventions and usage examples, see the dataset-viewer documentation:

[dataset_viewer/README.md](dataset_viewer/README.md)

## Generate training/validation/testing jsons/pkls

This repository includes a script to generate train/val/test jsons/pkls with syncronized sensors and annotations

For instructions, see the related documentation:

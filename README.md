TruckDrive is a long-range autonomous highway driving dataset designed for heavy-truck safety, perception, prediction, and planning research. It targets high-speed highway operation, where reliable scene understanding hundreds of meters ahead is required for anticipatory planning and safe braking.

This repository hosts the **TruckDrive Devkit** together with release documentation.

See [`LICENSE.txt`](./LICENSE.txt) for the full license text.

This devkit is distributed independently of the TruckDrive Dataset. The dataset is governed by separate license terms. See the [Dataset Repository](http://torc-ai.github.io/TruckDrive) for details.

## Downloading the full TruckDrive Dataset from Hugging Face
To download the dataset from Hugginfg Face use the provided [python script](download_truckdrive.py).

Download the full dataset:
```bash
python download_truckdrive.py \
  --out /PATH/TO/TruckDrive \
  --all-scenes \
  --all-modalities 
```
To download only one scene:
```bash
python download_truckdrive.py \
  --out /PATH/TO/TruckDrive \
  --scene scene_28_1 \
  --all-modalities 
```
To download only specific folders, replace --all-modalities with options such as:
--camera --lidar --radar --poses --calibration --annotations --accumulated-gt-depth

Add `--unzip` to extract each modality zip into the scene layout used by the [dataset viewer](dataset_viewer/README.md) (recommended).
To automatically remove the downloaded files after unzipping add: --remove-zips-after-unzip.

## Download the TruckDrive Dataset mini split (24 scenes)
To download the dataset use the provided [download script](download_truckdrive.sh). It runs on **bash 3.2+** (including macOS) and **zsh**; `python3` and `curl` are required.

For faster downloads, install `aria2` first:

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y aria2
```

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install aria2
```

Download the full dataset:
```bash
chmod +x download_truckdrive.sh
./download_truckdrive.sh \
  --out /PATH/TO/TruckDrive_download \
  --all-scenes \
  --all-modalities
```

Add `--unzip` to extract each modality zip into the scene layout used by the [dataset viewer](dataset_viewer/README.md) (recommended):

```bash
./download_truckdrive.sh \
  --out /PATH/TO/TruckDrive_download \
  --scene scene_28_1 \
  --all-modalities \
  --unzip \
  -y
```

After a download with `--unzip`, point the viewer at `--root-dir /PATH/TO/TruckDrive_download` (the same directory you passed to `--out`).

By default, the script uses aria2c automatically if it is installed, with --jobs 4 and --aria2-connections 8, otherwise it defaults to curl (slower).

To download only one scene:
```bash
./download_truckdrive.sh \
  --out /PATH/TO/TruckDrive_download \
  --scene scene_28_1 \
  --all-modalities \
  --unzip \
  -y
```

To download only specific folders, replace --all-modalities with options such as:
--camera --lidar --radar --poses --calibration --annotations --accumulated-gt-depth

## Highlights

- **475k** synchronized multimodal samples
- **165k** densely annotated frames
- up to **1,000 m** for 2D benchmark annotations
- up to **400 m** for 3D benchmark annotations
- **7** long-range FMCW LiDARs, **3** short-range LiDARs, **10** 4D radars, and **11-15** cameras
- supports perception, tracking, depth estimation, prediction, planning, and end-to-end driving

## Dataset Overview

TruckDrive targets long-range, highway-scale autonomous driving for semi-trucks and other heavy commercial vehicles. It is designed to stress perception and planning systems beyond the short-range assumptions common in urban autonomous-driving benchmarks.

## Dataset Viewer

This repository includes an interactive dataset viewer for inspecting TruckDrive scenes in 3D and 2D. The viewer supports synchronized LiDAR, radar, camera images, 3D bounding boxes, lane lines, accumulated depth overlays and video export.

For installation instructions, expected dataset layout, coordinate-frame conventions and usage examples, see the dataset-viewer documentation:

[dataset_viewer/README.md](dataset_viewer/README.md)

## Generate training/validation/testing jsons/pkls

This repository includes a script to generate train/val/test jsons/pkls with syncronized sensors and annotations

For instructions, see the related documentation:

[generate_training_data/README.md](generate_training_data/README.md)

## MMDetection3D Code

This repository includes code to run experiments in MMDetection3D with TruckDrive.

For instructions, see the related documentation:

[mmdet_project/README.md](mmdet_project/README.md)
